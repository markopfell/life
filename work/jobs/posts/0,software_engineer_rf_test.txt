SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.

SOFTWARE ENGINEER – RF TEST

RESPONSIBILITIES:

As a software engineer on the RF/RFIC team you will develop tools and reusable libraries for instrument control, data collection and analysis of the radio subsystems. You will use these tools to collect, analyze, and present measurement data to gain insight into both component and system performance. Much of the measurement system software and hardware that you create will be first-generation, supporting RF/RFIC designs well into the future.

The job includes:
• Proposing and developing a longer-term software architecture for automated test infrastructure, encompassing instrument control, data capture, data analysis and data organization.
• Designing and building unique and technically-challenging automated measurement systems, including both hardware and software design.
• Collaborating with the RF/RFIC engineers to create chip designs that are easily testable.
• Working closely with FPGA and ASIC engineers to design appropriate hardware control interfaces.
• Analyzing collected data and collaborating with RF/RFIC engineers to understand device performance and help resolve design issues.
• Supporting RFIC consumers by creating documentation, datasheets and fully-tested reference designs.

The job may include:
• Developing hardware systems, PCBs and digital control solutions (possibly microcontroller- or FPGA-based) for the test systems.

BASIC QUALIFICATIONS:
• Bachelor’s degree in computer science or electrical engineering.
• 2+ years of work experience in one or more of the following – C/C#/MATLAB/Python/C++.
• Previous experience with SQL or NoSQL.
• Previous work experience in development of multi-threaded applications and systems.

PREFERRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE:
• PhD or Masters of Science degree in CS/EE.
• Familiarity with MATLAB and/or JMP for data analysis.
• Familiarity with serial digital communication protocols such as SPI, I2C, JTAG, RFFE and software/hardware solutions to exercise these.
• Familiarity with microcontrollers, FPGAs, and/or basic digital signal processing concepts.
• Familiarity with radio-related test equipment such as spectrum analyzers, vector signal analyzers, vector signal generators, and network analyzers.
• Must have knowledge of statistical concepts and techniques.
• Must have strong communication skills and ability to work well within a fast-paced team.
• Must have strong troubleshooting and debugging skills.

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
• Must be willing to work extended hours and weekends as needed.

ITAR REQUIREMENTS:
• To conform to U.S. Government space technology export regulations, applicant must be a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident of the U.S., protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3), or eligible to obtain the required authorizations from the U.S. Department of State.
