%total yearly compensation: $198,682.21 + 90,000 stock valued at $3/share, paid $0.01/share w, company_size=20
&
\vspace{-0.15 cm}
Creating, evaluating, and documenting space-to-ground digital communications , and the mission data chain from modulated waveform to frames, packets, and end-to-end UDP connections. Evaluated with GNU Radio software defined transceiver simulations, technical deep dives into open source communication standards, collaboration on product (satellite imagery) level vision, and merging dev code to the processing pipeline.
\newline
\newline
Created a realistic and actionable plan to increase satellite constellation average payload data throughput by 42\% yielding a 14\% increase in capacity (directly correlated with revenue).  Validated the plan with large scale year-in-the-life Python link budget modeling and systems engineering showing minimal schedule delay, and technical risk.  Continuously building consensus with the founders: CEO, CTO, and CPO, on which space and ground communication business partnerships to pursue.

Designed, simulated, purchased, laid out, and validated: parts, mixed signal PCB, connectors, cabling, and enclosure for a GPS RF system self-compatibility filter.  Multiple spacecraft successful in-orbit operation.
%\newline
%\newline
%Building an open source link budget model to simulate: throughput, coverage, power, and bandwidth.
%\newline
%\newline
%Awarded for saving \$0.5 million in recurring cost for flatsat constellation test benches with a deep dive into the technical specifications of the ground and space hardware, and concurrence with vendors.
