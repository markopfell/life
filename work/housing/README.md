Why?
In California the majority of people drive everywhere fast and loud.  This means that there is even more emphasis on a quiet street to stay.  Most of the quiet streets Mark has personally lived on were 1 way streets.  1 way streets may be signed (best), or have just barely the width of two cars to pass further limiting the speed.  

quiet_streets.py performs three main steps:
1) From a given city search open street maps for quiet streets (one way streets)
2) From a filtered zillow rental search for the same city extract all rental addresses
3) Find (if any) rentals that are on one way streets
